## About me
I am a postdoctoral research associate at the [Princeton Center for Digital Humanities](https://cdh.princeton.edu), and my work focuses on developing technologies for low resource African languages. 
Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [RIKEN Centre for Advanced Intelligence Project](https://aip.riken.jp/), in the [Approximate Bayesian Inference Team](https://team-approx-bayes.github.io/)
where I spent time investigating the use of natural-gradient Bayesian methods to improve uncertainty estimation in PLMs.

I completed my Ph.D. in the [Knowledge & Data Engineering Lab](http://www.kde.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/index_en.html) at the [University of Tsukuba](https://www.sie.tsukuba.ac.jp/eng/) in Japan.
During my Ph.D, I was lucky to be advised by [Prof. Toshiyuki Amagasa](http://www.kde.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~amagasa/home/?IndexE) on making use of machine learning and computational linguistics to reason about language and knowledge. I focused on question answering over knowledge base systems.
For more information, [see my resume](/assets/pdf/Resume.pdf).
